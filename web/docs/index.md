In 2025, the Journées de l'Informatique Musicale and Linux Audio Conference join forces and will take place in Lyon (France) under the hospices of [Inria](https://inria.fr/), [GRAME-CNCM](https://grame.fr), [INSA Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/), and [AFIM](http://www.afim-asso.org/) as two successive events with shared ressources! You should expect many concerts, cool talks, fun social events, and great food! The calls for papers/music will be published by the beginning of September 2024 on this website: stay tuned!

## How Will It Work?

* All you need to know about the Journées de l'Informatique Musicale 2025 can be found on the [JIM page of the website (in French)](jim).
* All you need to know about the Linux Audio Conference 2025 can be found on the [LAC page of the website](lac).

JIM 2025 and LAC 2025 remain two independent events with their own call for works, proceedings, committees, rules, etc. but they will be hosted in the same venues, will share some social events as well as the same registration system.

The scientific portion of both conferences will take place at the Marie Curie Library of INSA Lyon: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/RZj75WC7PqSbj5bDA>

The artistic portion of both conference will take place at the Théâtre Astrée of Lyon 1 University: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/w6fFaHR4NSP6rXXo6>

At this stage, we envision the following registration options (this might be subject to changes):

* JIM registration: registration fee to cover lunches and the conference banquet.
* LAC basic registration: FREE (no lunches and no banquet included).
* LAC full registration: registration fee to cover lunches and the conference banquet.
* JIM + LAC pass: registration fee to covert lunches throughout the whole week and the conference banquet.
* Both JIM and LAC will be live streamed for free (no need to register for that).

Note to LAC's "purists:" LAC 2025 will take place during the summer break on a large campus: this means that there won't be that many options for buying food near the conference venue. This is why we're offering you the possibility to pay a fee to have all your lunches covered and to give you access to the conference banquet.
