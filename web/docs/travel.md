# Travel Information

JIM 2025 (June 23-25, 2025) and LAC 2025 (June 25-28, 2025) will both take place on the "Doua campus" in Lyon: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/AnB5HdP4vwZ28NES6>.

Please, note that the banquets of JIM 2025 and LAC 2025 will happen together as a single event in the evening of June 25, acting as a "bridge" between these two events. You should make sure to attend it (wether you're coming to the JIMs, LAC, or both), it will be fun! It will also feature live performance by members of the LAC community. 

## Getting to Lyon

### By Car

Trafic in Lyon is bad and it is hard and expensive to park your car. You should also have a "Vignette Crit'Air" smaller or equal to 2. All that to say that we don't advise you to use this option :). 

### By Train

Lyon Part Dieu train station is one of the largest in Europe. It is well connected to most cities in France and to neighboring countries (Switzerland, Italy, Germany, etc.). Both SNCF (<https://www.sncf-connect.com/>) and Trenitalia (<https://www.trenitalia.com/>) serve Lyon Part Dieu.

### By Plane

There are two way to get to Lyon by plane:

* Fly to Paris de Charles de Gaulle (CDG) and then take the direct TGV train from that airport that will take you directly to Lyon city center (Part Dieu Railway Station) in 2 hours. If you fly with AirFrance, your train ticket can be integrated to your plane ticket and booked directly on the AirFrance website.
* Fly to Lyon Saint-Exupéry airport (LYS) and then take the RhôneXpress (<https://www.rhonexpress.fr/en_GB>) to the city center. Lyon's airport is well connected to most cities in Europe and to Montreal. Be aware that RhôneXpress is expensive (16 euros one way for a 30 mins ride).

## Staying in Lyon

Lyon is not that big and public transportations work well. 

If you would like to be as close as possible (walking distance) to the conference venue, you might wanna stay in one of these hotels:

* Hôtel des Congrès by Arteloge: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/ig6CQBtMiC5e3CiS6>
* Hôtel Ibis Style: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/7dSGxSB1HsxzjKD36>
* Hôtel Ibis Budget: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/AjVRWG1kBP9w8Fhz9> (cheaper, slightly further option)

If you prefer to be in a more urban neighborhood with a lot of bars, you can aim for the "Brotteaux" neighborhood: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/LK36Yhz5nNnHVXpw7> (only 10 mins away from campus with Tramway T1 or T4).

If you would like to stay in the historical city center (with even more bars and restaurants), you should aim for the "Presqu'île" (between the 2 rivers) or the "vieux Lyon" neighborhood (<https://maps.app.goo.gl/5ckNGVc3qDEwhV1B8>). You can reach campus within 25 mins from most parts of this area taking the metro and then the tramway T1/T4 to campus from the Charpennes station.

## Getting Around the City

As mentioned above, public transportation works well in Lyon (TCL: <https://www.tcl.fr/>). Lyon is also very "bikable", especially thanks to the "Velov" service: <https://velov.grandlyon.com/en/home>.
