# Travel Information

JIM 2025 (June 23-25, 2025) and LAC 2025 (June 26-28, 2025) will both take place on the INSA Lyon campus: <https://maps.app.goo.gl/QJBC7eCs5i76pdiL9>.

Additional travel information will be posted when the registration portal will open, towards the end of Winter 2025.

Lyon is not that big though and public transportations work well: you can get a place anywhere in the city for these events.
