### Full Papers

Full papers must be written and presented in English. The length of papers is 4 to 8 pages, with up to 5 keywords, including an abstract of up to 200 words. The abstract will be published on the conference website once the paper has been accepted. Full papers will be available on the website during the conference, and after in the proceedings (which will be published with an ISBN number).

All papers are peer reviewed by a committee of experts from different disciplines. Reviewers may suggest improvements to the author(s), require changes in order to accept the submission, or reject it.

Full papers will be presented during the conference as in-person oral presentations.

### Presentations Without an Associated Paper

LAC 2025 welcomes oral presentations not associated to a peer-reviewed paper published in the conference proceedings. Such presentations are selected by the scientific committee, based on a abstract up to 500 words, with up to 5 keywords. **No full paper is required in this category**. The abstract will be available on the website during and after the conference.

Presentations in this category have the same format as full paper presentations and will hence be presented during the conference as in-person oral presentations.

### Demos

Demos are informal project (e.g., plug-in, software, interface, idea, etc.) presentations that will be carried out between the papers presentation sessions.

### Workshops

Workshop presentations (max duration of 2h) should be 1-4 pages, with up to 5 keywords, including an abstract of up to 150 words to be published on the conference website. Make sure that your proposal indicates if participants are expected to have a specific level, if there are prerequisites, if you'd like to limit the number of participants, if you have specific technical requirements, etc.

### How to Submit Papers / Posters / Workshops?

All the submission should be carried out through this portal: [https://lac25.sciencesconf.org/](https://lac25.sciencesconf.org/)

Choose the relevant submission type.

The required file format is PDF. For the full paper category, authors must use the provided [template](misc/lac25Template.zip) for paper formatting (see below). For the other categories, your PDF should contain the title of your presentation/demo/workshop, the name of the authors and their affiliations, an abtsrcat/description (you can either use the full paper template or your own).

Please let us know if you need a special technical setup for your presentation.

### Templates

We provide only the following LaTeX template (sorry MS-Word users...): [template](misc/lac25Template.zip).

## Call for Music

We invite submissions of electronic, electroacoustic and mixed music as well as interactive art installations with an emphasis on open source software. A jury will select the compositions and performances to be included in the LAC 2025 conference program according to artistic merit and technical feasibility. Applicants should expect to perform their work themselves and have all resources needed to perform the piece if selected (e.g., instruments, props, other performers, etc.).

### Concert Venues

The LAC 2025 musical program will consist of three concerts, two of which will take place at Le Théâtre Astrée (<https://theatre-astree.univ-lyon1.fr/qui-sommes-nous/>), a concert hall equipped with an 8.4 sound system. For this venue, we are particularly interested in electronic / computer music pieces that will leverage the multichannel set up. The third concert will take place at Le Sucre  (<https://le-sucre.eu/le-lieu/>), an event that will host live coding sets and other performances devised for a night club setting with stereo diffusion.


### How to Submit Music

* Use the [LAC 2025 Online Submission Tool](https://lac25.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en) and select the "music" submission type in the submission form.
* The required file format is PDF, formatted for A4 paper size. Submissions should include: (i) description of piece and set-up, (ii) program notes, (iii) links to samples of work: .wav files, videos, etc., and (iv) a technical rider.
