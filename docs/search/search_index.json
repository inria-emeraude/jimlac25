JIM 2025 and LAC 2025 remain two independent events with their own call for works, proceedings, committees, rules, etc. but they will be hosted in the same venues, will share some social events as well as the same registration system.

LAC concerts will take place on June 26 and 27 with potentially a \"special\" live coding concert on the 28th. JIM and LAC will have a joint banquet on June 25th which will serve both as a closing event for the JIM and a welcoming event for LAC. At this stage, we envision the following registration options (this might be subject to changes): JIM registration: registration fee to cover lunches and the conference banquet. LAC basic registration: FREE (no lunches and no banquet included). LAC full registration: registration fee to cover lunches and the conference banquet. JIM + LAC pass: registration fee to covert lunches throughout the whole week and the conference banquet. Both JIM and LAC will be live streamed for free (no need to register for that). Note to LAC's \"purists:\" LAC 2025 will take place during the summer break on a large campus: this means that there won't be that many options for buying food near the conference venue. This is why we're offering you the possibility to pay a fee to have all your lunches covered and to give you access to the conference banquet.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#jimlac-2025-june-23-28-2025-lyon-fr","text":"","title":"JIMLAC 2025 - June 23-28, 2025 - Lyon (FR)"},{"location":"#journees-de-linformatique-musicale-jim-23-25-juin-2025-linux-audio-conference-lac-june-26-28-2025","text":"In 2025, the Journ\u00e9es de l'Informatique Musicale and Linux Audio Conference join forces and will take place in Lyon (France) under the hospices of Inria , GRAME-CNCM , INSA Lyon , and AFIM as two successive events with shared ressources!

A jury will select the compositions and performances to be included in the LAC 2025 conference program according to artistic merit and technical feasibility.

For this venue, we are particularly interested in electronic / computer music pieces that will leverage the multichannel set up. The third concert will take place at Le Sucre ( https://le-sucre.eu/le-lieu/ ), an event that will host live coding sets and other performances devised for a night club setting with stereo diffusion.
